# Bulldozer Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict the sale price of bulldozers. The project is directly inspired by an older Kaggle competition, aiming to demonstrate a robust application of regression analysis in a real-world scenario within the construction industry.

### Project Composition

The notebook encapsulates a comprehensive methodology for predicting bulldozer prices, employing a series of sophisticated data handling and machine learning strategies to optimize prediction accuracy. It rigorously follows a structured pipeline from data preprocessing, feature engineering, to regression modeling, culminating in the minimization of Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE).

## Project Details

- **Problem Definition**: Develop a predictive model that estimates future sale prices of bulldozers based on their historical sale data and intrinsic characteristics.
- **Data Source**: Utilizes a rich dataset from a historical Kaggle competition, segmented into:
  - `Train.csv` - Training set with data up to the end of 2011.
  - `Valid.csv` - Validation set from January 2012 to April 2012.
  - `Test.csv` - Test set, comprising data from May 2012 to November 2012.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Model evaluation focuses on RMSLE between the actual and the model-predicted auction prices, aiming for minimal error to enhance predictive precision.
