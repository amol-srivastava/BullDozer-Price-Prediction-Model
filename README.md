# Bulldozer Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to predict the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. This project is inspired by an older Kaggle competition and aims to provide insights into the application of regression models in a real-world context.

### What is inside?

The notebook outlines a proof of concept for predicting bulldozer prices using historical data. The approach is detailed with an emphasis on preparing the data, training a regression model, and evaluating it with the goal of minimizing the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE).

## Project Details

- **Problem Statement**: Predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of sale prices.
- **Data**: The data used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle competition, which includes:
  - `Train.csv` for training data up to the end of 2011.
  - `Valid.csv` for validation data from January 2012 to April 2012.
  - `Test.csv` for test data available during the last week of the competition, covering May 2012 to November 2012.
- **Evaluation Metric**: The model's performance is evaluated based on RMSLE between the actual and predicted auction prices, with a goal to minimize this error.
